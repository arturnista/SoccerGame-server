                The Backend of the game is entirely build in Node.js, using socket.io for the client-server communication. The physics engine was entirely build by me, as a self challenge.
                The site was built using React and PIXI.js renders the game. The art was also done by me.

Hello,
I saw the available jobs opening on your website.
I'm a Game Developer for a long time, but for now I don't have any professional experience at this field.
I have 5 years of experience in IT, 3 of them as a Web developer mainly in Javascript, developing backend (NodeJS), frontend (React) and mobile (React-Native).
My focus is to start a career in game developing, a field that I always loved.
I already made some games, like the ones below:

NW Game - http://nwgame.pro
A online Battle Arena with a Smash Bros like mechanic, where the objective is to throw your enemies out of the arena using spells.

Destruction Chain - Play Store
An android Game developed on Unity 3D, a spaceship shooting game with the differential that one enemy hit causes a chain reaction, creating more projectiles every consecutive hit.
