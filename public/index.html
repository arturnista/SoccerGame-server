                    <h3>NW Game</h3>
                    <p class="justify">Online Battle Arena with a Smash Bros like mechanic, where your objective is to throw your enemies out of the arena using your spells.</p>
                    <p class="justify">The <strong>Backend</strong> of the game is entirely build in Node.js, using socket.io for the client-server communication. The <strong>Frontend</strong> was built using React and PIXI.js as the rendering engine. The art was also done by me.</p>
                    <p class="justify text-sep">My mainly motivation for creating this game was learn to build a multiplayer game. The server was my focus, as I come from a web background. I wanted to create an engine that could be easy to develop new features and have multiple games running at the same time.</p>
                    <p class="justify">I used a Component System, like Unity3D uses. Each entity could have multiple components, like being an Physics entity, having an AI (like a bot), having buffs and debuffs, and any other component.</p>
                    <p class="justify">In the first version of the server architecture the same Node process handled multiple game servers. This was a problem because os some reasons:</p>
                    <p class="justify">Node being single thread, multiple games can be a problem for the engine. This could become very heavy on the machine because multiple connections would be open in the same process. And, as an indie game, it has some bugs. Sometimes the server crash and all games go down.</p>
                    <p class="justify text-sep">Then I updated the server to be handled by multiple process. Each game is a different process created by the main server and can handles themself.</p>
                    <p class="justify">Today all games run in the same machine, budgets reasons, but, they can run in multiples servers. That way, the problem of multiple connections in the same machine would be solved. And, if a game crashing bug happens, only that game would go down, not messing up with other servers.</p>
                    <p class="justify">Also, the physics of the game was also created by me. Is a top-down physics engine, so the main event that must be handled is collision. Today, the engine handles only circle objects (colliders), that can be filled or hollow.</p>

                    <h3>Lady of the Colors</h3>
                    <p class="justify">Platform with puzzles. You can fly to avoid obstacles and get close to your objective.</p>
                    <p class="justify">Game developed in Unity 3D, with more focus on game and level design.</p>
                    <p class="justify text-sep">This game is heavily inspired by Celeste, as my intentions were to create a platform with a little set of player mechanics, that could be changed and developed using interesting level design.</p>
                    <p class="justify">The development follows a composition strategy, as every components is self-contained, working independent of others.</p>
                    <p class="justify">For example, in the game you can fly. This action consume fly fuel, that can be refilled collecting some special objects, like refill orbs and save points. Every object that refills your fly fuel, has the same component, that the only purpose is to refill your fuel.</p>
